# Heptabase to Obsidian Converter

A pure frontend web application to export your data from Heptabase to Obsidian format.

## Site

<https://heptabase-obsidian-migrate.wildsky.cc/>

## Why This Project?

This project was created to provide a maintained and accessible alternative for Heptabase users:

1. **Original service unavailable**: The original project's web service at https://link-ding-heptabase-export-app-revtm6.streamlit.app/ is no longer accessible
2. **Maintenance status**: The original project was last maintained 4 years ago (as of this writing), and may not support newer Heptabase features

This rewrite aims to:
- Provide a reliable, always-available tool (pure frontend, no server dependencies)
- Support modern Heptabase features and data structures
- Ensure your data stays private by processing everything locally in your browser
